    <h3>Findings</h3>
    <p>Over the year, we as a nation have collected some incridible findings from space. This includes vivid pictures from our many<br>
    satellites and rovers. We have also collected samples from the Moon and Mars, although the Mars samples haven't been seen in person<br>
    as it would take years to get those samples back to Earth. But there are multiple rock and dirt samples from the Moon that were brought<br>
    back by some of the fearless astronauts. Check out some pictures of the findings below.</p>
