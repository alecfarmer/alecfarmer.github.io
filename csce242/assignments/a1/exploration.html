    <p>Space exploration is incridible if you truly stop and think about it. The United States of America has been on the moon.<br>
        We've sent multiple human beings our of our atmosphere and into another "plsnet's" atmosphere. We have multiple satellites<br>
        orbiting the Earth, right above our heads. Some take pictures of galaxies far, far away. We've even sent a rover to Mars. I'd<br>
        say our exploration efforts are truly amazing. Check out the satellite pictures below to get a sense of how amazing space really is.</p>
