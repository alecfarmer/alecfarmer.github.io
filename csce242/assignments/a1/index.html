    <p>Space... The Final Frontier. Science proves that we know more about space then we do our own ocean. But is that true?<br>
    Space exploration seems to always get questioned anytime it's spoken of. Some even believe that we've never been to space and<br>
    that it was all a hoax. Truly interesting. Take a look around this site and see if I can't change you mind about the knowledge<br>
    we have about space.</p>
